        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>I'm a native Washingtonian (born and raised in Olympia) who has been
            living in Seattle for about 4 years. I abosolutely <em>love</em> all the
            green here and the close proximity to hiking!</p>
          <p>I currently work at the Attorney General's Office as a paralegal, but I am
            looking for a new challenge with a career in computer coding. I love
            the rush of solving puzzles and making things work. Let's do this!</p>
          <h5>My current hobbies are:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Hiking</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Playing with my cats</li>
            <li><strong>CODING</strong></li>
